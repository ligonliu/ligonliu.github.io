    <p>Explains my practices and concerns in optimizing the performance of python code.</p>

<p>Move fast and break things. Python is the language choice for rapid iteration and prototyping. When the code eventually mature, sometimes performance becomes the next thing to work on.</p>

<p>A few steps before doing code optimization:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Look for mature high performance libraries, such as numpy, scipy and google or-tools, for the heavy crunches. They usually have highly optimized kernels written in C/Fortran. However, a seasoned developer probably already know and employ these libraries, because they make the coding quicker and the code cleaner, so our innovative algorithms are already in the no-lib-land.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try various static and JIT compilers as drop-in replacement for CPython intepreter, such as Cython, Numba and PyPy. Usually, these compilers significantly improve performance for a few lines of code rewriting. Note: PyPy is fast by itself, but incompatible with many high performance libraries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upgrading hardware. Hardware is cheaper than developer time. Nevertheless, before spending money and man-hour on hardware, try the program on any cloud provider’s higher end cloud units to evaluate performance improvements. In many cases, a higher end server only marginally improve performance, because the critical section would not use additional resources.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After doing the above, if the performance is still insufficient, we continue with the following <strong>brain stretching</strong> optimization steps.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-bottleneck">Finding the bottleneck</h2>

<p>90% of performance improvement are found by optimizing 10% of code. The numbers could be 80:20 or 99:1, nevertheless we need to find the hot sections before doing any meaningful optimization. There are two approches.</p>

<h3 id="static-analysis">Static analysis</h3>
<p>The time complexity of each part can be statically derived by looking at the code. For example, there could be obviously O(1), O(n) and O(n<sup>2</sup>) part of the code, and from the libraries documents we know the cost of library function calls. These part with higher asymptotic complexity can be singled out for optimization.</p>

<p>Static analysis does not always find the culprit, because there are hidden overheads, such as function call, memory allocation, object creation and exception handling overheads that break asymptotic analysis, which can be found in profiling.</p>

<h3 id="profiling">Profiling</h3>
<p>Profiling is a different approach – it measures time spent in each part of the program in test runs. Profiles such as python’s profile and cProfile can be used to gather a profile log, and visualizers like SnakeViz display the profile log in more obvious ways.</p>

<p>Because we cannot profile on every possible input, we profile on typical inputs and practically worst case inputs.</p>

<h2 id="optimizing-against-the-bottleneck">Optimizing against the bottleneck</h2>

<p>A bottleneck is usually a block of code (a loop or a function). We begin by writing down on paper a description of what the block does and all its inputs. Hopefully there are obvious easy ways to improve it.</p>

<p>There could be no easy ways to improve it, or the easy ways does not provide enough squeeze, which is actually quite common since we tend to have written crappy code for rapid iteration, and CPython is anyway not a platform for high performance.</p>

<p>Our efforts are not wasted, because we can refactor and outsource the bottleneck to a higher performance platform, such as C++/C/Java, to reduce at least the constant factor.</p>

<h3 id="comments-on-higher-performance-platforms">Comments on higher performance platforms</h3>
<p>C++/C/Java are only platforms, not magic bullets. They rely on understanding and requires some manual calibration. A program could be slow even it’s written in C, plus the drawback of maintenability.</p>

<p>Keep complexity and dependency at minimum. The complexity involves complexity of the algorithm itself and complexity of interoperation.</p>

<p>Do not underestimate the complexity, as every programming language has specific data types, calling conventions and compile/link mechanisms, that often don’t interact. It’s probably not a problem for numpy developers, but a big headache for most programmers.</p>

<p>The complexity is aggravated by the fact that a developer is usually good at one language. We can make another developer code the non-python part, yet the gateway between both codes has to be maintained by both developers together. The collaboration overhead is not trivial.</p>

<h3 id="ways-to-call-foreign-code-from-python">Ways to call foreign code from Python</h3>
<p>Here is a list of ways of calling C(C++/Java) functions from python, ranked by complexity. Again, use the</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>subprocess</em> invokes passing arguments by command line and files in temporary path</li>
  <li>local interprocess mechanisms (pipes, named pipes, shared memory mapping)</li>
  <li>RPC frameworks, such as gRPC and Thrift</li>
  <li>foreign language interfaces (Python.h, cffi, ctypes, pybind11, cython, py4j) that have object-level access to foreign program</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simplify-foreign-code">Simplify foreign code</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Preprocess data in python.The foreign code should have as few lines as possible for preprocessing data.</li>
  <li>Strip irrelevant data and simplify data structure.The input data should contain as little irrelevant information as possible. It is usually worthy to strip irrelevant data and transform data structure to the simplist possible in Python as the input of the foreign function, because</li>
  <li>Use a common serialization/deserialization scheme for custom data structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toy-example-dijkstra-like-function">Toy Example: Dijkstra-like function</h2>

<p>The original code is written by a student for the <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort/">“minimum effort”</a> programming challenge. The code is correct, yet inconsiderate of performance. It “abuses” python containers for set semantics, it fails to use the proven priority queue data structure to hold intermediate result, etc. We will demostrate its bottleneck by profiling.</p>

<p>The original programming question is similar but different to shortest path, that we cannot simply call an existing shortest path library function. Thus, the strategy is to grab some proven Dijkstra code and modify it for our purpose.</p>

<p>We improved performance by 115x just by optimized data structure using pure python, and 2818x using python calling C++ subroutine with ctypes. Click <a href="example_minimum_effort.html"><strong>here</strong></a> for details in a separate page.</p>
