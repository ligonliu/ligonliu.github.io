    <p>offgrid living, which used to be arduous and uncomfortable, is worth reviving with modern technology.</p>

<p>Despite urbanization being the proven way to economic prosperity and life quality, it has hit bottlenecks in almost all the developed world.</p>

<h2 id="advantages-of-offgrid-living">Advantages of offgrid living</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Economic freedom.</p>

    <p>Offgrid living is simple and cheap, allowing offgriders to live with relatively shorter work hours, so in case the work is not fulfilling, there could be more time for self actualization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environment friendly.</p>

    <p>With biomass and solar panels as energy source, offgrid homes use much less fossil energy than urban homes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Escape from high crime areas.</p>

    <p>Keeping urban communities safe is a more complex task compared to rural communties. Many cities are ill managed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hedging against unaffordle home prices.</p>

    <p>Even for urban dwellers, having the choice of moving to an offgrid location improve their negotiation position.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exploring the wilderland.</p>

    <p>It’s part of human nature and enjoyment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disaster Preparedness.</p>

    <p>Grid could be offline under a major disaster such as earthquake, terrorist attack and nuclear war.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenges-of-offgrid-living">Challenges of offgrid living</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Transportation — transit and cargo</li>
  <li>Energy — electricity and fuel</li>
  <li>Heating and cooling — living in comfortable temperature</li>
  <li>Water — tap water and wastewater</li>
  <li>Telecom — internet and phone</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-case-studies">My case studies</h2>
<p>Urban housing is industrial, commercial and standard. Offgrid housing is natural, diverse and adaptive. Offgrid living space must be designed according to the climate, resources and infrastructure of the location.</p>

<p>Offgrid living is better studied through cases, for which I have considered 3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mojave Desert</li>
  <li>Saskatchewan Priaries</li>
  <li>Small van/RV on urban lot</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="on-water-saving-and-reusing-in-arid-areas">On water saving and reusing in arid areas</h2>

<p>Many arid areas have limited precipitation, making rain water impossible to rely on. Water has to be trucked into offgrid homes.</p>

<p>The only feasible way is extreme water saving.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/how-we-use-water">EPA</a>,</p>

<p>Toilet, Shower, Faucet, Clothes Washer, Leak are five main categories of water usage.</p>

<h3 id="toilet">Toilet</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Incineration toilets don’t use water, but electric heat to break down and gasify human waste.</li>
  <li>Outhouses can be located a distance from main residence, and use solar heat to desiccate human waste into combustible “dung cakes” that can be augered into a fuel container.</li>
  <li>All heat-based waterless toilets require tall flue pipe to discharge smelly exhaust.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shower">Shower</h3>
<p>Shower water can be filtered and recirculated for many times, until it’s too soapy for showering.</p>

<h3 id="hand-washing">Hand washing</h3>
<p>Similar but easier than shower, a basin of water for hand washing can be kept for a long time, with bariostatic agents such as benzyl alcohol.</p>

<h3 id="dishwasher">Dishwasher</h3>
<p>Dishwashers can recirculate the cleaning agent in a closed loop. White vinegar is a good cleaning agent for its cleaning power and antiseptic, properties. Filters can be used to catch the food debris for periodic removal.</p>

<h3 id="solar-distilling">Solar distilling</h3>
<p>Water saturated with impurities and soap can be solar distilled. In order to keep distilled water scentless, scentless detergents and shampoos should be used in kitchen and bathroom.</p>
